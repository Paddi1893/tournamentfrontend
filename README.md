# The Tournament Manager

## What is it?
With this Website you can create your own knockout tournaments.
At the moment it is optimized for table soccer, so by default it creates teams of 2, which infers that a even number of members is required

### How does it work?
as soon as the website is live, you will be able to: 
 - create a user profile
 - login / logout
 - create multiple tournaments with an individual amount of members
 - then create random matchups and enter the results of the games
 - once all games have been played you can proceed to quarter-finals, semi-finals and finally the finals! 
 - at the moment a minimum of 12 teams (24 Members) is required
 - updates for less players
